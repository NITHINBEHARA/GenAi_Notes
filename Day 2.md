## DAY 2 

## 6. Neural Networks

Neural Networks are machine learning models inspired by the human brain, made of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. In cinema, a neural network is like a basic film crew where each department contributes small inputs to create a final scene. Each neuron processes part of the information and passes it forward. Neural networks work well for pattern recognition.
Real-time example: face detection in cameras.
Use cases: image recognition, speech recognition, handwriting detection.

## 7. Deep Learning and Backpropagation

Deep Learning is an advanced form of neural networks with many hidden layers that can learn complex patterns, while backpropagation is the method used to correct mistakes and improve learning. In film terms, deep learning is like a large production team with specialists for lighting, sound, editing, and VFX, while backpropagation is like reviewing the final cut and correcting mistakes scene by scene. This process improves accuracy over time.
Real-time example: voice assistants understanding speech.
Use cases: self-driving cars, medical image analysis, Gen AI models.

## 8. Tokens

Tokens are small units of text (words or parts of words) that AI models use to understand and generate language. In cinema, tokens are like individual dialogue beats or frames that together form a complete scene. AI reads and processes text token by token. Token count affects memory, cost, and performance of models.
Real-time example: ChatGPT breaking sentences internally.
Use cases: chatbots, summarization, translation systems.

## 9. Parallelism

Parallelism is the ability to process multiple tasks at the same time instead of sequentially. In film production, it is like editing, sound mixing, and color grading happening simultaneously. In Gen AI, parallelism allows faster training and response generation. It improves efficiency and scalability.
Real-time example: large language model training on GPUs.
Use cases: real-time chat systems, large-scale data processing.

## 10. Transformers

Transformers are deep learning models that use attention mechanisms to understand relationships between all tokens at once. In cinema, a Transformer is like a director who reads the entire script together and understands how every scene connects. Unlike older models, Transformers do not forget earlier context. They use self-attention to focus on important words.
Real-time example: ChatGPT, translation tools.
Use cases: Gen AI, summarization, question-answering systems.
