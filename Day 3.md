## 11. Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture meaning and relationships. In film terms, embeddings convert scenes into coordinates so similar scenes appear closer together. This allows machines to compare meaning instead of exact words. Similar texts have similar embeddings.
Real-time example: finding similar movie descriptions.
Use cases: semantic search, recommendation systems, RAG pipelines. 
## Scenario:
In a grocery store like Dmart or Vijetha, items are organized into clearly defined sections such as fruits, drinks, and cosmetics
. Each section is assigned a specific aisle number; for example, aisle 1 may represent the fruits section. 
Within that aisle, every item is given its own position number, such as apple being assigned number 5 and banana being assigned number 6.
As a result, an apple can be represented by the coordinates (1,5) and a banana by (1,6). In the same way, all items in the store have unique coordinates
based on their section and position. This coordinate-based system makes it easy to track items, find similar products, manage inventory,
and quickly match customer searches to exact products. In Generative AI, embeddings work in a similar way by converting words, sentences,
or data into numerical coordinates so that related items are placed closer together, making searching, matching, and recommendations faster
and more accurate.
